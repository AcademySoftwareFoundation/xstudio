This intial open source version of xSTUDIO should be considered as a 'preview' release as the development team get to grips with maintaining the code base on a public repo. There are still some major features under development so we expect some parts of the code to change and expand considerably.

  - Create any number of playlists
  - Drag and drop within or betweemn playlists to reorder and organise media

**Media**

  - Display virtually any image format (EXR, TIF, JPG, MOV, etc)
  - Drag and drop media from the filesystem
  - Audio playback

**Notes**

  - Add notes and annotations to media
  - Sketch, Shapes and Laser modes
  - Adjustable colour, opacity and size
  - Add editable text captions over the image in any colour or size

**The Viewer**

  - Colour accurate (OCIO v2 colour management)
  - Adjust exposure and playback rate
  - Zoom/pan image, RGBA channel display

  - Adjustable masking and guide-lines

What can I expect from future releases?
