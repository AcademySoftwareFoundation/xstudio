.. note::
    August 2025: The C++ API documentation is WIP. For developers interested in developing C++ we encourage you to look over the source code of xSTUDIO's native plugins. These are to be found inside the **src/plugin** folder from the root of the xSTUDIO source repo.

    Many of xSTUDIO's important features have been implemented as plugins. Primarily this approach was taken to ensure that xSTUDIO can be expanded and modified in the future without needing to re-work core components of the source code. In addition this both ensures that the C++ plugin API is well-developed and flexible and also provides a rich set of reference implementations for new developers to begin working from for their own projects.

    Nevertheless, we will strive to improve the API Class documentation here over the coming months.
