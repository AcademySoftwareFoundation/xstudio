* Clone this project to your local drive.  Tips to consider:
  * The path should not have spaces in it.
  * Ideally, keep the path short
  * Ensure your drive has a decent amount of space free (at least ~40GB)
  * The rest of this document will refer to this location as ${CLONE_ROOT}

* Before loading the project in Visual Studio, consider modifying ${CLONE_ROOT}/CMakePresets.json
  * Edit the `Qt5_DIR` if you did not install in C:\Qt
  * Edit the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to your desired output location
    * This should be outside the build directory in a location where you have permissions to write to.

* Open VisualStudio 2022
  * Use Open Folder to point at the ${CLONE_ROOT}
  * Visual Studio should start configuring the project, including downloading dependencies via VCPKG (which it bootstraps itself).
  * Once configured, you can switch to the Solution Explorer's solution view to view CMake targets.
  * Double-click `CMake Targets View`
  * Right-click on `xStudio Project` and select `Build All`
  * One built, right-click on `xStudio Project` and select `Install`


* If the build succeeds, navigate to your ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin and double-click the `xstudio.exe` to run xStudio.
