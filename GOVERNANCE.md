# xSTUDIO Project Governance

The xSTUDIO project is governed by its Committers in collaboration with the Open Review Initiative (ORI) Steering Committee (TSC).

xSTUDIO is a relatively new project and is still under very active development as we approach a version 1.0 release. An xSTUDIO TSC will be formed whern the project has reached both a level of stability and community engagement which demands such governance. Until then discussions about the direction of the project will be held in the ORI  Community Meetings or with direct interaction with the current [COMMITERS](COMMITERS.md).

## Contributors

Contributors include anyone in the community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts that have been incorporated into the project's repository.

## Committers

The xSTUDIO GitHub repository is maintained by the [COMMITERS](COMMITERS.md). Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify source code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the project. Upon becoming Committers, they become members of the xSTUDIO leadership team.

Their privileges include, but are not limited to:

* Commit access to the xSTUDIO repository
* Moderator status on all communication channels

### Committer Activities

Typical activities of a Committer include:

* Helping users and novice contributors
* Contributing code and documentation changes that improve the project
* Reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests
* Participation in Open Review Initiative community meetings
* Merging pull requests

The xSTDUIO TSC, when it has been formed, will periodically review the Committer list to identify inactive Committers. Past Committers are typically given Emeritus status. Emeriti may request that the TSC restore them to active Committer status.

## Technical Steering Committee

A description of the xSTUDIO TSC, its members, their roles and how the TSC will govern the xSTUDIO project will be provided when the TSC is formed.
