         *  @details
         *   This class receives frame buffers from the playhead ready for display in
         *   the viewport. It allows frames to be received at almost any rate and at
         *   any time which is important for accurate syncing of what is on screen with
         *   the playhead position. Meanwhile, the viewport, whose caf::messages
         *   are generally handled (for Qt apps) within the main UI event loop, will
         *   ask this class to tell it which frame buffers it should be uploading/displaying
         *   whenever the viewport is drawing itself. The reason for doing it this way
         *   is that caf messages processed by Qt mixin actors can get out of order or
         *   arrive late if the Qt event loop is heavily loaded (for example doing expensive
         *   ui redraws). Using this actor we can preserve the integrity of the
         * instantaneous queue of frame buffers that are ready to be drawn to the screen.
