# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to xSTDUIO. We warmly encourage all contributions and the managers of this repository will do their best to assist you with any questions as well as act as effective reviewers and approvers.

## Project Roles and Responsibilities

Please read this document to learn how to contribute to xSTUDIO.

Start by getting familiar with the [GOVERNANCE](GOVERNANCE.md) document. It details the rules and responsibilities for Contributors, Committers, and Technical Steering Committee members.

## Committers

The xSTUDIO Project Committers are listed in alphabetical order, by first name, in [COMMITERS](COMMITERS.md)

## Contributor License Agreement

Before contributing code to xSTUDIO source code, you must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

You will get the opportunity to sign the CLA when you create your first pull request: the Linux Foundation's EasyCLA system will guide you through the process of signing the CLA.

Here are the two possible CLAs:

There are two contribution agreement types, one for individuals contributing independently, and one for corporations who want to manage a list of contributors for their organization. Please review the documents in the EasyCLA portal to determine which is the right one for you.

## Coding Conventions

Please follow the coding style accross the various file types in the project as best you can. While we have strived to maintain a consistent formatting to the code you may find there are differing styles thanks to the various authors and their natural preferences. We suggest you do your best to follow what's already there but we will not impose a strict style on new code in PRs. We do periodically run clang auto formatting across the C++ components of the codebase. Clang formatting rules are defined in the .clang-tidy and .clang-format files in the root.
